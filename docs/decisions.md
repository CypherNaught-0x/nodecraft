## 2026-10-16 · Settings through craft-settings (#55)

- **App id `nodecraft`** for the folder and `NODECRAFT_CONFIG_DIR`; schema version 1.
- **Portable marker is `portable.txt`** (the Windows portable zip ships one), so the zip tells
  people what the file does; settings go in `config/` beside the executable.
- **Values from the file are hostile:** read them through clamping accessors
  (`CanvasSettings::zoom_speed()`), and an unknown enum value resets only its section.
- **A file with a newer `schema_version` is read but never overwritten** (craft-settings makes
  the store read-only), so running an older build doesn't destroy a newer build's settings.
- **The store lives in the shell** (`NodeCraftApp` ticks it each frame and flushes on exit) and
  is native only; the browser build uses defaults. Changing settings from the UI, CLI or MCP waits
  for the command registry (#52) and goes through a `settings.set` command.
## 2026-10-16 · media: sniffing, decode, thumbnails (#56)

- **Formats are sniffed from bytes, never from file names**, and the sniffed MIME type picks the
  decoder (`ImageReader::set_format`), so a mislabelled file can't reach a different decoder.
- **`image` without default features**, decoding PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP and TIFF. No `rayon`
  (wasm) and no AVIF/HEIC decode yet: those are sniffed and reported as unsupported. Animated GIF
  and WebP decode to their first frame.
- **Every decode is capped** (`media::Limits`: 256 MiB input, 16384 px per side, 1 GiB decoder
  allocations by default). The caps are checked from the header before pixels are allocated:
  most `image` decoders ignore `max_alloc`, so `media` reserves the decoded size (plus the copy an
  EXIF rotation makes) against it itself.
- **Images are upright:** EXIF orientation is applied on decode, and `ImageMeta` reports the
  displayed size.
- **`media::ContentHash` is BLAKE3**, matching the asset store's `assets/<blake3>` names. `media`
  can't depend on `types`, so `types`' hash type should convert from its `[u8; 32]`.
- **Thumbnails are RGBA8 with straight alpha**, cached by (content hash, max edge) in a
  memory-budgeted LRU (`ThumbnailCache`). The cache isn't thread-safe; its owner decides where
  thumbnails are made.

## 2026-10-16 · M0 skeleton

- **Layer numbering follows the plan (L0–L5), not PhotoCraft's L0–L7.** The rule "only the shell
  uses UI crates" is an allow-list (`ui-egui`), because `agent` and `automation` share the shell's
  layer but must stay headless.
- **`media` is standalone** (no workspace deps). `graph` depends on it, not the other way round.
- **Empty crates already declare their planned workspace dependencies**, so the layering check is
  meaningful from day one and the dependency graph is visible in `cargo xtask layers`.
- **craft-libs pinned at `8f5a283`.** `craft-ui` and `craft-quit` are used by the shell now;
  `craft-settings`, `craft-atomic` and `craft-pdf` are pinned in `[workspace.dependencies]` but
  unused until M1/M8. Note that `craft-pdf` relies on `[patch.crates-io]` entries in craft-libs'
  own workspace (vendored `krilla`/`hayro`), which do not apply to a git dependency; check this
  when `craft-pdf` is first used.
- **`ui-egui` depends on eframe with `wgpu`** (not only egui) so the `eframe::App` impl lives in
  the shell and `cargo test -p nodecraft-ui-egui` builds on its own; eframe without a renderer
  feature does not compile on macOS.
- **Canvas navigation:** scroll pans and pinch/⌘-scroll zooms (trackpad-first, like the reference
  products); see `ui-design.md`.
- **Releases:** our own `release.yml`, modelled on the shared Craft release workflow, because the
  shared one fails on the `release` branch without Apple and Windows signing secrets and we have
  none yet (#100). Ours signs when secrets exist and otherwise ships unsigned builds with
  first-launch instructions (`docs/install.md`). It is written from scratch (craft-common-actions
  has no licence file, so its text isn't copied). Targets: macOS universal, Windows x64/arm64,
  Linux x86_64/aarch64 + Flatpak; the web job comes with `apps/nodecraft-web` (#99). Switch back
  to the shared workflow once signing is in place, if it is still the better fit.
